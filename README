OptWrapper v0.6
---------------

This is a python wrapper for numerical optimization libraries. It contains two general types of objects: problems and solvers. This version has been tested using Python 2.7 and 3.5, and Cython 0.21.

Currently we implement the following problems:
- Quadratic and Linear Programming Problems (qp.Problem)
- Nonlinear Programming Problem (nlp.Problem), and its sparse gradient version (nlp.SparseProblem)
- Constrained Optimal Control Problem (ocp.Problem)
- Constrained Switched Optimal Control Problem (socp.Problem)

We provide interfaces for the following solvers:
- LSSOL (lssol.Solver)
- NPSOL (npsol.Solver)
- SNOPT (snopt.Solver)
- IpOpt (ipopt.Solver)

The documentation is sketchy, so for the time being you should take a look at the examples (in the 'examples' folder) and, if you feel brave, you can also take a look at the source code.
If you want to tweak the optional parameters in any of the solvers then you will have to take a look at the corresponding manuals.
Options are defined via the 'options' dictionary, which is a an attribute of each solver.
For example, to set the option 'Print Level' to value '10' in a solver we write:
> solver.options['Print Level'] = 10


Requirements
------------

- SCons
- Python (either 2.x or 3.x)
- Cython
- NumPy

Installation
------------

To build the package run:
% scons

To install locally for your user only (recommended) run:
% scons --local install

To install for all users run:
% (sudo) scons install

To uninstall run:
