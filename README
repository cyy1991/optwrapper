OptWrapper
----------

This is a python wrapper for numerical optimization solver libraries. It contains two general types of objects: problems and solvers. This version has been tested in Python versions 2.7 and 3.4, and Cython version 0.21 and 0.22.

Currently there are three problems:
1. Nonlinear programming (nlp.Problem)
2. Sparse nonlinear programming (nlp.SparseProblem)
3. Constrained optimal control (ocp.Problem)
and two solvers:
1. NPSOL (npsol.Solver)
2. SNOPT (snopt.Solver)

The documentation is sketchy and most likely outdated, so for the time being you should read the code if you want to know how a particular feature works. A few simple-yet-illustrative examples are included in the 'examples' folder.


Requirements
------------

- Python (either 2.x or 3.x)
- Cython
- NumPy + SciPy
- NPSOL 6
- SNOPT 7
- f2c


Installation
------------

To install the package using Python's distutils either run:
% sudo make install
for an all-users installation, or:
% make install_local
for a single-user installation.

To uninstall the package run:
