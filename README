OptWrapper v0.5
---------------

This is a python wrapper for numerical optimization libraries. It contains two general types of objects: problems and solvers. This version has been tested in Python 2.7 and 3.4, and Cython version 0.21 and 0.22.

Currently we implement the following problems:
- Quadratic and Linear Programming Problems (qp.Problem)
- Nonlinear Programming Problem (nlp.Problem), and its sparse gradient version (nlp.SparseProblem)
- Constrained Optimal Control Problem (ocp.Problem)
- Constrained Switched Optimal Control Problem (socp.Problem)

We provide interfaces for the following solvers:
- LSSOL (lssol.Solver)
- NPSOL (npsol.Solver)
- SNOPT (snopt.Solver)

The documentation is sketchy, so for the time being you should take a look at the examples (in the 'examples' folder) and, if you feel brave, you can also take a look at the source code.
If you want to tweak the optional parameters in any of the solvers then you will have to take a look at the corresponding manuals and the definition of the 'solveOpts' dictionary in each of the Cython source files.


Requirements
------------

- Python (either 2.x or 3.x)
- Cython (only if you want to modify the .pyx files)
- NumPy + SciPy
- NPSOL 6
- SNOPT 7


Installation
------------

To install locally for your user only (recommended) run:
% make install_local

To install for all users run:
% (sudo) make install

To uninstall run:
% make uninstall
