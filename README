OptWrapper
----------

This is a python wrapper for numerical optimization libraries. It contains general objects: problems and solvers. This version has been tested in Python 2.7 and 3.3.

Currently there are two problems:
1. Nonlinear Programming Problem (nlp.Problem)
2. Sparse Nonlinear Programming Problem (nlp.SparseProblem)
and two solvers:
1. NPSOL (npsol.Solver)
2. SNOPT (snopt.Solver)

The documentation is sketchy and most likely outdated, so for the time being you should read the code if you wonder how a particular feature works. Two (very simple) examples are provided in the 'examples' folder.
